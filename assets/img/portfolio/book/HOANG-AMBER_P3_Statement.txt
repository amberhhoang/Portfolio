Project 03: Type Zine is about designing a book. Students have to choose three articles in the reading reflection assignment for the zine. The zine is all about what you want the reader to feel and know about the article, the messages that you want to deliver. 
I had a hard time to start this project because I cannot think of what I want to design, what message I try to convey, and what information should be included. I kept revisiting the examples folder of this project to see what they do, what information they have, and what it means by a zine. Therefore, I started the project kind of late than other classmates. When I figured out the idea for the zine. I immediately illustrated ideas then picked fonts, and start my layout everything in InDesign. I had fun working on this project at the same time stress because this is a final project. I would say I learned one of the most important elements of design anything that every book starts with an idea. The first article in my zine helped me finish this zine.
