              Going to the beach should be an escape from our busy lives. Unfortunately our beaches today are filled
              with trash and litter. Not only does this create an unwelcoming place but it has a huge impact on our
              coastal environment. Let’s look at the different ways our coastal environment is affected by our beach
              litter.
            </p>
            <h5>The Challenge</h5>
            <p>Develop a third-party mobile app that encourages local coastal communities to take action and help
              preserve their coastal environments.</p>
            <h5>Upshore Ideations</h5>
            <li>The beach isn’t just a great place to spend your Saturday afternoon at, the beach is home to countless
              creatures. As it may be easy to forget that visiting the beach is just like visiting someone’s home,
              belongings and waste is often left to pollute the area.</li>
            <li>Upshore is here to control that damage. This app allows you to learn about your beach, how to properly
              dispose of waste, and connect with your community. Whether you want to navigate nearby trash or keep up
              with the latest coastal news, Upshore’s got you!</li><br>
            <strong>App Features:</strong>
            <li>Waste scanner</li>
            <li>Current weather and location</li>
            <li>Follower and Followings</li>
            <li>Profile Posts</li>
            <li>Article Search</li><br>
            <h5>The ocean</h5>
            <p>Hazardous chemicals from the litter can pollute soil and water. And through the food chain, these toxins
              not only make their way to animals but they make their way back to humans. Through litter, nitrogen and
              phosphorus can become abundant in water. This causes harmful algal blooms to accumulate quickly in waters
              and can block sunlight which ultimately creates a depletion of oxygen. The algae also can release toxins
              that can be harmful to both animals and humans.</p>
            <br><strong>CORAL REEFS</strong>
            <p>Trash such as plastic bags, singular used products, kids toys, produce containers, water bottles, etc.
              That makes its way into the sea and can snag on corals and block the sunlight needed for photosynthesis,
              or entangle and kill reef organisms and break or damage corals. The micro plastics were eaten by coral and
              other sea animals which can block their digestive tracts and potentially introduce toxics.</p>

            <br><Strong>ANIMALS</Strong>
            <p>Trash pollution at beaches affects more than 800 species. Over 100,000 seabirds, sea turtles, seals, and
              other marine mammals are killed every year by consuming the litter or being stuck in it. It’s easy for
              animals to mistake our trash for food so when they try to eat it, they choke or suffer internal injuries.
              Again the trash eventually ends up in our stomachs as plastic moves through the food chain. Animals like
              sea
              turtles also have trouble reproducing as climate change has affected the temperatures of the sand.</p>
            <br><strong>THE ECONOMY</strong>
            <p>When the public takes responsibility and disposes of their trash, cleaning waste isn’t too difficult. But
              when there is an excess amount of trash, then extra funds are needed to hire people to clean up littered
              areas. It costs the economy more money to clean up compared to if citizens were to properly dispose of
              waste themselves.</p>
            <br><strong>PUBLIC HEALTH</strong>
            <p>Not only is the economy at risk but so is the health of people. When people have contact with dirty water
              or sand it can be harmful. A 2013 study collected water samples from coastal regions and 10 percent of the
              samples failed to meet the EPA’s standards for safe swimming. About 3.5 million people get sick from water
              contaminated with sewage.
              <br>Children are especially vulnerable as they tend to swallow a lot more water. They can consume
              criteria, fertilizers, feces, and trash. These effects can be as minor as a stomach ache to as severe as a
              neurological disorder. Those who have compromised immune systems are especially at risk. At times there
              will be a delay in systems so most people who experience illness from dirty waters don’t even know the
              cause of their symptoms.
